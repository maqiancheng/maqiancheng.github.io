Today, I gave my final presentation on [Smalltalk\-80](http://smalltalk.heroku.com/), and received great feedback from my fellow craftsmen regarding my apprenticeship challenges.  The feedback was very positive and rewarding.  In the end, Micah offered a Software Craftsman position at 8th Light!  I immediately accepted and will be coming into the office next week as a craftsman.  I'm super excited and look forward to continuing to challenge myself and build quality software.  I'm also happy to be part of a team who cares about the craft and quality in the work they do.

Since my apprenticeship has officially ended, this will be my last blog post.  I will continue to post over on my other [blog](http://skim.la/).
